  abstract = {We consider the problem of learning from examples in layered linear feed-forward neural networks using optimization methods, such as back propagation, with respect to the usual quadratic error function E of the connection weights. Our main result is a complete description of the landscape attached to E in terms of principal component analysis. We show that E has a unique minimum corresponding to the projection onto the subspace generated by the first principal vectors of a covariance matrix associated with the training patterns. All the additional critical points of E are saddle points (corresponding to projections onto subspaces generated by higher order vectors). The auto-associative case is examined in detail. Extensions and implications for the learning algorithms are discussed.},

  abstract = {Dynamical models underpin our ability to understand and predict the behaviour of natural systems. Whether dynamical models are developed from first-principles derivations or from observational data, they are predicated on our choice of state variables. The choice of state variables is driven by convenience and intuition, and, in data-driven cases, the observed variables are often chosen to be the state variables. The dimensionality of these variables (and consequently the dynamical models) can be arbitrarily large, obscuring the underlying behaviour of the system. In truth these variables are often highly redundant and the system is driven by a much smaller set of latent intrinsic variables. In this study we combine the mathematical theory of manifolds with the representational capacity of neural networks to develop a method that learns a system's intrinsic state variables directly from time-series data, as well as predictive models for their dynamics. What distinguishes our method is its ability to reduce data to the intrinsic dimensionality of the nonlinear manifold they live on. This ability is enabled by the concepts of charts and atlases from the theory of manifolds, whereby a manifold is represented by a collection of patches that are sewn together---a necessary representation to attain intrinsic dimensionality. We demonstrate this approach on several high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behaviour. The resulting framework provides the ability to develop dynamical models of the lowest possible dimension, capturing the essence of a system.},

JAX uses the XLA compiler infrastructure to generate optimized code for the program subroutines that are most favorable for acceleration, and these optimized subroutines can be called and orchestrated by arbitrary Python. Because the system is fully compatible with Autograd, it allows forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation of Python functions to arbitrary order. Because JAX supports structured control flow, it can generate code for sophisticated machine learning algorithms while maintaining high performance. We show that by combining JAX with Autograd and Numpy we get an easily programmable and highly performant ML system that targets CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, capable of scaling to multi-core Cloud TPUs.},

  abstract = {We further develop a recently introduced variational principle of stationary action for problems in nonconservative classical mechanics and extend it to classical field theories. The variational calculus used is consistent with an initial value formulation of physical problems and allows for time-irreversible processes, such as dissipation, to be included at the level of the action. In this formalism, the equations of motion are generated by extremizing a nonconservative action \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}\$, which is a functional of a doubled set of degrees of freedom. The corresponding nonconservative Lagrangian contains a potential \$K\$ which generates nonconservative forces and interactions. Such a nonconservative potential can arise in several ways, including from an open system interacting with inaccessible degrees of freedom or from integrating out or coarse-graining a subset of variables in closed systems. We generalize Noether's theorem to show how Noether currents are modified and no longer conserved when \$K\$ is non-vanishing. Consequently, the nonconservative aspects of a physical system are derived solely from \$K\$. We show how to use the formalism with examples of nonconservative actions for discrete systems including forced damped harmonic oscillators, radiation reaction on an accelerated charge, and RLC circuits. We present examples for nonconservative classical field theories. Our approach naturally allows for irreversible thermodynamic processes to be included in an unconstrained variational principle. We present the nonconservative action for a Navier-Stokes fluid including the effects of viscous dissipation and heat diffusion, as well as an action that generates the Maxwell model for viscoelastic materials, which can be easily generalized to more realistic rheological models. We show that the nonconservative action can be derived as the classical limit of a more complete quantum theory.},

Calculations are also performed with two popular but nonsymplectic integrators. The most efficient integrators of the set investigated are deduced.

What is to follow, therefore, represents a combination of the methods of the formal calculus of variations with those of Lie's group theory. For special groups and problems in variation, this combination of methods is not new; I may cite Hamel and Herglotz for special finite groups, Lorentz and his pupils (for instance Fokker), Weyl and Klein for special infinite groups. Especially Klein's second Note and the present developments have been mutually influenced by each other, in which regard I may refer to the concluding remarks of Klein's Note.},

Employing the symplectic integrators for MD algorithms, there is a conserved quantity which is close to Hamiltonian. Therefore, they can perform a MD simulation more stably than by conventional nonsymplectic algorithms. They applied this algorithm to a TIP3P pure water system at 300K and compared the time evolution of the Hamiltonian with those by the nonsymplectic algorithms. They found that the Hamiltonian was conserved well by the symplectic algorithm even for a time step of 4fs. This time step is longer than typical values of 0.5--2fs which are used by the conventional nonsymplectic algorithms.},

Since the simulations themselves are differentiable functions, entire trajectories can be differentiated to perform meta-optimization. These features are built on primitive operations, such as spatial partitioning, that allow simulations to scale to hundreds-of-thousands of particles on a single GPU. These primitives are flexible enough that they can be used to scale up workloads outside of molecular dynamics. We present several examples that highlight the features of JAX MD including: integration of graph neural networks into traditional simulations, meta-optimization through minimization of particle packings, and a multi-agent flocking simulation.

While recent advances in deep learning have generated renewed interest in such approaches, the development of symbolic regression methods has not been focused on physics, where we have important additional constraints due to the units associated with our data. Here we present \${\textbackslash}Phi\$-SO, a Physical Symbolic Optimization framework for recovering analytical symbolic expressions from physics data using deep reinforcement learning techniques by learning units constraints. Our system is built, from the ground up, to propose solutions where the physical units are consistent by construction. This is useful not only in eliminating physically impossible solutions, but because the "grammatical" rules of dimensional analysis restrict enormously the freedom of the equation generator, thus vastly improving performance. The algorithm can be used to fit noiseless data, which can be useful for instance when attempting to derive an analytical property of a physical model, and it can also be used to obtain analytical approximations to noisy data. We test our machinery on a standard benchmark of equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics and other physics textbooks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the presence of noise (exceeding 0.1\%) and show that it is robust even in the presence of substantial (10\%) noise. We showcase its abilities on a panel of examples from astrophysics.},
